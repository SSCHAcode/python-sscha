! This is the input to perform the sscha minimization, followed
! by the change of the unit cell given by the stress step.
!
! This is not the recommended way to do it (you can do everything automatically)
! But it can be very easy if you came from the sscha.x fortran code.
!
!
! In this example we setup a new namelist: 'relax'.
! It is used to setup the relaxation among many sscha minimizations.
! In this example we want to setup a 'vc-relax' optimization, with only one step
! (we do not want to regenerate forces and stresses for a new ensembe).
! Then we need to setup the 'inputscha' as always, to load the ensemble.

&relax
	! We want a 'vc-relax' calculation
	type = "vc-relax"

	! The initial population
	start_pop = 2
	! We want to stop after only one step (without generating a new)
	max_pop_id = 2

	! Get the ensemble from 'inputscha'
	! NOTE: by default the esemble is re-extracted by this method
	generate_ensemble = .false.

	! We want to perform a standard vc-relax with target pressure
	! So we do now want to fix the volume, and we need to specify
	! a target pressure:
	fix_volume = .false.
	target_pressure = 0 ! [GPa]

	! We can provide a bulk modulus,
	! in this way the algorithm will guess the best step.
	bulk_modulus = 15 ! [GPa]

	! We need to specify also here the number of configurations
	! This is because usually this namespace is able to generate
	! new ensembles to perform several minimizations
	! (if a calculator/cluster namespace is provided)
	! (for details, see the Cluster example)
	n_configs = 1000

	! If you choose to save the ensemble,
	! you can specify a directory:
	! ensemble_datadir = 'data'
	! Note: the ensemble will be saved in binary data.
&end

	
! Now we need to specify the minimization variables
! As always
&inputscha
    ! The dimension of the ensemble
    n_random = 1000
    
    ! The position of the ensemble (where the data are stored).
    ! Take a look to that to see how to dispose your ensemble.
    ! Unit of measurements must be in bohr for displacements and 
    ! Ry/bohr for forces and Ry/bohr^3 for stress tensors.
    ! Energy is in Ry.
    data_dir = "../ensemble_data_test"
    
    ! The population id. This is an integer that distinguish different ensembles
    ! and allows for use the same data_dir for several minimizations
    population = 2
    
    ! Now we must tell the program where is the dynamical matrix that
    ! generated the ensemble. 
    ! This matrix should be written in the Quantum ESPRESSO file format
    fildyn_prefix = "../ensemble_data_test/dyn"
    
    ! We should tell the number of irriducible q points (how many files are)
    nqirr = 1
    
    ! The supercell size
    supercell_size =  1 1 1
    
    ! The temperature used to generate the ensemble (in Kelvin)
    Tg = 0 
    
    ! The temperature that will be used in the minimization (in Kelvin)
    T = 0
    
    ! The stopping criteria. The code will end the minimization after
    ! the gradient is lower than meaningful_factor times its stochastic error
    meaningful_factor = 1e-4
    
    ! But which gradient?
    ! We are minimizing both the structure and the dynamical matrix
    ! Therefore we can specify to the code which gradient is used to trigger the
    ! stopping condition.
    ! By default, both of them should satisfy the meaningufl criteria.
    ! Options are "all", "gc", and "gw".
    ! "all" - both the gradient should satisfy the meaningulf (default)
    ! "gw"  - only the wyckoff (i.e. structure) gradient.
    ! "gc"  - only the force-constant matrix gradient.
    gradi_op = "all" 
    
    ! The Kong-Liu effective sample size. 
    ! This is a stochastic test, during the minimization the effective
    ! size of the ensemble is reduced by the importance sampling. When this size
    ! becomes lower than the given threshold the minimization is stopped,
    ! and you should re-generate a new ensemble.
    ! Usually in the begining you can chose 0.1-0.3 the original ensemble,
    ! and raise it to 0.4 or 0.5 when you are close to convergence.
    n_random_eff = 500
    
    ! This flag is used by the old code to make it seek for the pressures
    ! in the ensemble. However it is ignored by the python code, that will print
    ! the stress if it finds the stress tensor inside the ensemble automatically
    ! In this case it must be used to do a vc-relax
    print_stress = .true.
    
    ! The following flag set the equilibrium energy.
    ! It should be the energy of the structure without fluctuations,
    ! it is used to separate the electronic and the vibrational energy,
    ! since they are usually of different order of magnitude.
    ! It is measured in Ry
    eq_energy = -144.40680397
    
    ! The following are the step size for the minimization
    ! They are dimensionless and builded so that their best value should be 1
    ! However, especially in the first step, this can be a very drastic jump
    ! leading to neagive frequencies, it is wise in the beginning to decrease it.
    ! lambda_a : step for the force constant matrix
    ! lambda_w : step for the structure
    lambda_a = 1
    lambda_w = 1
    
    ! The root representation is a trick to increase the speed of the minimization
    ! And to avoid the imaginary frequency error (the force-constant matrix is constrained
    ! by a nonlinear change of variable to be positive defined).
    ! The python new code is not able to do simultaneously precondition
    ! and root_representation.
    ! - "normal" : normal minimization, can lead to imaginary frequencies
    ! - "sqrt"   : square root representation.
    ! - "root4"  : fourth-root represnetation, the best one (and the slowest).
    root_representation = "normal"

    ! Preconditioning allows for a very fast minimization!
    ! Note that it is much faster than the fortran code
    ! (it is implemented in a more intelligent way)
    preconditioning = .true.

    ! The maximum number of steps after which the code is automatically stopped
    max_ka= 20
