! Connection file to the IRENE supercomputer
! this is just an example.
! IRENE works with standard slurm utilities
! therefore no custom variable declaration is needed
!
! Note that you will node the file inside init_script
! "$SSCHA_CLUSTERS_DIR/load_irene.sh"
! In the local computer, this is used to specify any extra
! variable to be setted up before the calculation.
! In this case, it just contains the module loading:
! module load espresso

&cluster
	! Connection info
	hostname = "irene"
	account = "ra4186@skylake"
	partition_name = "skylake"
	pwd = "C0ns3rv@t0ri0!!!"
	
	! This is necessary, the directory in which to carry the
	! simulation.
	! You can use the evironmental variables of the cluster,
	! they will be parsed correctly.
	! This directory will be created if not present
	workdir = "$CCCSCRATCHDIR/test"

	! The path to the executable (qe in this case)
	! NPOOL will be replaced by n_pools, while PREFIX with the name
	binary_path = "pw.x -npool NPOOL -i PREFIX.pwi > PREFIX.pwo"

	! The command for the parallel mpi execution
	! NPROC will be substituted with the right choice.
	mpicmd = "ccc_mprun -n NPROC -E'--exclusive' "

	! Load the espresso module
	! This is a script copied in the beginning of the calculation
	init_script = "$SSCHA_CLUSTERS_DIR/load_irene.sh"

	! Resources (I think they are pretty self explaining)
	use_nodes = .false. ! Do not specify the nodes count
	n_cpu = 16 
	n_pools = 1
	n_time = "00:01:00"  ! 1 minute (it must be a string)
	! Note you can also specify the ram as n_ram

	! We can specify the submission strategy
	! This means 10 jobs per works
	job_numbers = 10
	! Runned togheter 2 by 2 (sharing the same nodes)
	n_together = 2
	timeout=6 ! Max number of second per single job

!
! This is the setup of a QE calculator
! It is used in the cluster
!
&calculator
	! The calculator type
	program = "quantum-espresso"
	
	! We take only a gamma point calculation
	k_points = 2 2 1
	k_offset = 0 0 1

	! Here the pseudopotentials
	! Note they are pseudo_ followed by the atom name
	pseudo_H = "H.bare.upf"

	! Here all the specific qe variables
	tprnfor = .true.
	tstress = .true.
	ecutwfc = 60
	ecutrho = 240
	occupations = "smearing"
	smearing = "mv"
	degauss = 0.03
	input_dft = "blyp"
	disk_io = "none" ! This is very important!!!
