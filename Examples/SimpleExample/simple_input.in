! This input file perform the minimization
! You can use it as a template for your personal minimizations

!
! To run the new python code use:
! >>> sscha -i simple_input.in --save-data simple_input.out
!
! To run the fortran code use:
! >>> sscha.x < simple_input.int > simple_input.out
!
! The python code will produce two output, one in stdout (that can be redirected)
! and one in the save-data file, already formatted for the plot.
! Lunch sscha -h to see details on other options (also a plotter can be activated)
! The sscha code will only produce the stdout, that must then be parsed with
! a separate script to analyze the minimization.

! To have a better control on the minimization, you can always run the 
! minimization directly using a python script, importing the sscha library.
! Follow the example.py to see a description


! Each input file requires a main namelist, called inputscha, starting with &.
! This is the Quantum ESPRESSO format for input file.
! Inside the namelist the input variables must be inserted.
! Note that the order in which they are specified is not important.

! Marking points '!' are used as comments, and all the text that follows them
! will be ignored

    ! In the old fortran code we must specify if we want to generate a new ensemble
    ! or perform the minimization. This flag is not used by python (probably it will in future).
    ! "minim" - start the minimization loading the ensemble from data_dir
    ! "scfin" - generate a new ensemble in the data_dir
    !type_cal = "minim"

    ! The dimension of the ensemble
    n_random = 1000
    
    ! The position of the ensemble (where the data are stored).
    ! Take a look to that to see how to dispose your ensemble.
    ! Unit of measurements must be in bohr for displacements and 
    ! Ry/bohr for forces and Ry/bohr^3 for stress tensors.
    ! Energy is in Ry.
    data_dir = "../ensemble_data_test"
    
    ! The population id. This is an integer that distinguish different ensembles
    ! and allows for use the same data_dir for several minimizations
    population = 2
    
    ! Now we must tell the program where is the dynamical matrix that
    ! generated the ensemble. 
    ! This matrix should be written in the Quantum ESPRESSO file format
    fildyn_prefix = "../ensemble_data_test/dyn"
    
    ! We should tell the number of irriducible q points (how many files are)
    nqirr = 1
    
    ! This is a dumb variable for now, it is used by the Fortran code to setup the supercell
    supercell_size =  1 1 1
    
    ! The temperature used to generate the ensemble (in Kelvin)
    Tg = 0 
    
    ! The temperature that will be used in the minimization (in Kelvin)
    T = 0
    
    ! The stopping criteria. The code will end the minimization after
    ! the gradient is lower than meaningful_factor times its stochastic error
    meaningful_factor = 1e-4
    
    ! But which gradient? We are minimizing both the structure and the dynamical matrix
    ! Therefore we can specify to the code which gradient is used to trigger the 
    ! stopping condition. By default, both of them should satisfy the meaningufl
    ! criteria. Options are "all", "gc", and "gw".
    ! "all" - both the gradient should satisfy the meaningulf_condition (default)
    ! "gw"  - only the wyckoff (i.e. structure) gradient must satisfy the condition
    ! "gc"  - only the force-constant matrix gradient must satisfy the condition.

    ! The Kong-Liu effective sample size. 
    ! This is a stochastic test, during the minimization the effective
    ! size of the ensemble is reduced by the importance sampling. When this size
    ! becomes lower than the given threshold the minimization is stopped,
    ! and you should re-generate a new ensemble.
    ! Usually in the begining you can chose 0.1 the original ensemble, and raise it to 0.4 or 0.5
    ! when you are close to convergence.

    ! This flag is used by the old code to make it seek for the pressures

    ! the stress if it finds the stress tensor inside the ensemble automatically.

    ! The following flag set the equilibrium energy. It should be the energy
    ! of the structure without fluctuations, it is used to separate the electronic

    ! The following are the step size for the minimization
    ! They are dimensionless and builded so that their best value should be 1
    ! However, especially in the first step, this can be a very drastic jump
    ! leading to neagive frequencies, it is wise in the beginning to decrease it.

    ! lambda_w : step for the structure
    lambda_a = 1
    lambda_w = 1
    
    ! The root representation is a trick to increase the speed of the minimization
    ! And to avoid the imaginary frequency error (the force-constant matrix is constrained
    ! by a nonlinear change of variable to be positive defined).
    ! Currently, it does not work in the python program (it is ignored), while it
    ! is very usefull in the fortran code.
    ! - "normal" : normal minimization, can lead to imaginary frequencies
    ! - "sqrt"   : square root representation.
    ! - "root4"  : fourth-root represnetation, the best one (and the slowest).
    root_representation = "normal"
    
    ! This two flags are used only by the fortran code (but only for now)

    ! so here we activate it only in the structure, and not in the force-constant matrix

    !precond_only_wyckoff = .true.
    
    ! This is used only in the fortran code, if not specified the structure
    ! is not minimized (ignored by the python code).

    ! by setting the step to 0 (lambda_a or lambda_w)

    ! We can choose to use spglib for symmetrization (the default one is Quantum ESPRESSO)

    ! This is slower if the supercell is big.
    use_spglib = .true.

    ! We can also chose if we want disable the symmetrization
    ! The Acoustic sum rule will still be used. Usefull if we want to
    ! Relax a structure.
