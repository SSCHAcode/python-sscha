# --- Meson-python specific configuration (Optional but useful) ---
[tool.meson-python]
# Here you can pass options to Meson that control the build process.
# For example, to enable debugging or specify a different installation path.
# By default, meson-python takes care of using the virtual environment if it exists.

# build-args = ["-Dbuildtype=debug"] # Uncomment for a debug build
# setup-args = ["--prefix=/opt/python-sscha"] # For a non-standard installation
